            <h1>Paper size</h1>
            
            <p>Paper size standards govern the size of sheets of paper used as writing paper, stationery, cards, and for some printed documents.</p>

            <p>The ISO 216 standard, which includes the commonly used A4 size, is the international standard for paper size. It is used across the world except in North America and parts of Central and South America, where North American paper sizes such as "Letter" and "Legal" are used.[1] The international standard for envelopes is the C series of ISO 269.</p>
            
            <h2>International standard paper sizes </h2>
            
            <p>The international paper size standard is ISO 216. It is based on the German DIN 476 standard for paper sizes. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series. ISO paper sizes are all based on a single aspect ratio of the square root of 2, or approximately 1:1.41421. There are different series, as well as several extensions.</p>
            
            <p>The following international paper sizes are included in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): A3, A4, A5, B4, B5.[2]</p>

            <p>_____</p>
            
            <p>or, rounded to the nearest millimetre, 1,189 mm × 841 mm (46.8 in × 33.1 in).</p>
            
            <p>A series sizes are related in that the smaller dimension of a given size is the larger dimension of the next smaller size, and folding an A series sheet in half in its larger dimension—that is, folding it in half parallel to its short edge—results in two halves that are each the size of the next smaller A series size. As such, a folded brochure of a given A-series size can be made by folding sheets of the next larger size in half, e.g. A4 sheets can be folded to make an A5 brochure. The fact that halving a sheet with an aspect ratio of √2 results in two sheets that themselves both have an aspect ratio of √2 is proven as follows:</p>

            <p>By 1975, so many countries were using the German system that it was established as an ISO standard, as well as the official United Nations document format. By 1977, A4 was the standard letter format in 88 of 148 countries. Today the standard has been adopted by all countries in the world except the United States and Canada. In Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and the Philippines, the US letter format is still in common use, despite their official adoption of the ISO standard.</p>
            
            <p>The weight of an A-series sheet of a given paper weight can be calculated by knowing the ratio of its size to the A0 sheet. For example, an A4 sheet is 1⁄16 the size of an A0 sheet, so if it is made from 80-g/m2 paper, it weighs 1⁄16 of 80 g, which is 5 g.</p>

            <p>However, they have a different area. The area of B series sheets is in fact the geometric mean of successive A series sheets. B1 is between A0 and A1 in size, with an area of 0.707 m2 (1⁄√2 m2). As a result, B0 is 1 metre wide, and other sizes of the series are a half, a quarter, or further fractions of a metre wide: in general, every B size has exactly one side of length _____. That side is the short side for B0, B2, B4, etc., and the long side for B1, B3, B5, etc.</p>
            
            <p>While less common in office use, the B series is used for a variety of special applications.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>B4, B5, and B6 are used for envelopes that fit C-series envelopes.</li>
                <li>B5 is a relatively common choice for books.</li>
                <li>B7 is equal to the passport size ID-3 from ISO/IEC 7810.</li>
                <li>Many posters use B-series paper or a close approximation, such as 50 cm × 70 cm ~ B2.</li>
